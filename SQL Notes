SQL Notes

With every single type of database, the main things that you'll be doing with it is the following:

Create 
Read
Update
Destroy

CRUD, for short.

Here is some relvant searches to go through via W3Schools:

SQL Key Words
SQL Data types
SQL Primary Keys
SQL Insert Into

Now it's time to create your table in SQL

CREATE TABLE products (
 id INT,
 name STRING,
 price MONEY,
 PRIMARY KEY (id)
)

*Table should be blank so far since there is no information*

INSERT INTO products
VALUES (1, "Pen", 1.20)

*You should now see one row of information within your 'products' table*

If you want to skip a field, for example, add another record which is not the product we have in the table, 
so it doesn't have a set price; you can insert into the 'products' table the data that you have by specifying the columns that you have data for.

INSERT INTO products (id, name)
VALUES (2, "Pencil")

*You should have this within your products table, leaving the price empty/NULL*

This is how you would create a new table using the Structered Query Language (SQL) 
and also how you would start inserting pieces of data into your table. 



But how would you read and seach through your table to find a particular piece of data?

SQL Select: This allows you to read the data from your database.

For example: When you see the entire table, you will see the following line of code:

SELECT * FROM products

However, if you only wanted one column or two coulumns from the table then instead of an asterix, you can simply write the following:

SELECT name, price FROM products

But what if you want a particular row from your database?

SQL Where

SELECT * FROM products WHERE id=1



How do you Update records in your database?

For example, the current price of a pencil on our table shows as 'NULL'

If I wanted to update that record to now provide a value for the price of my pencil then I can use the SQL Update statement.

UPDATE products 
SET price = 0.80 
WHERE id=2

The UPDATE keyword is used to specify the table you want to update and then you SET the values that you want to update; and you can specify WHERE to only update the records that you were interested in updating.

What if you wanted to change the table instead of a particular record? What if you also wanted to keep track of the stock of each of your products? This'll mean you'd need a new column.

This is where the SQL Alter Table Statement comes in. It's used to add, delete or modify columns in an existing table. This is how you write it:

ALTER TABLE products
ADD stock INT
