SQL Notes

With every single type of database, the main things that you'll be doing with it is the following:

Create 
Read
Update
Destroy

CRUD, for short.

Here is some relvant searches to go through via W3Schools:

SQL Key Words
SQL Data types
SQL Primary Keys
SQL Insert Into

Now it's time to create your table in SQL

1. Create

CREATE TABLE products (
 id INT,
 name STRING,
 price MONEY,
 PRIMARY KEY (id)
)

*Table should be blank so far since there is no information*

INSERT INTO products
VALUES (1, "Pen", 1.20)

*You should now see one row of information within your 'products' table*

If you want to skip a field, for example, add another record which is not the product we have in the table, so it doesn't have a set price; you can insert into the 'products' table the data that you have by specifying the columns that you have data for.

3. Update 

INSERT INTO products (id, name)
VALUES (2, "Pencil")

*You should have this within your products table, leaving the price empty/NULL*

This is how you would create a new table using the Structered Query Language (SQL) and also how you would start inserting pieces of data into your table. 

But how would you read and seach through your table to find a particular piece of data?
